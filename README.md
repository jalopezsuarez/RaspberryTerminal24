## Creating Thin Client System for Industrial Environments with Raspberry Pi and Debian OS

Creating a thin client terminal using Raspberry Debian OS, customized for industrial settings, leveraging the Raspberry Pi barebone built on ARM architecture.

```
Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)
Debian version: 12 (bookworm)
System: 64-bit
Kernel version: 6.1
Release: December 5th 2023
Compatible: 3B, 3B+, 3A+, 4B, 400, 5, CM3, CM3+, CM4, CM4S, Zero 2 W
```

## Flashing the official image onto an 8GB SD Card with Raspberry Pi Imager

Utilizing the official Raspberry Pi Imager program version 1.8.1 to install the image onto an 8 GB SD Card for system deployment.

```

###  User and Password Configuration on First Boot

```
User: pi
Password: [PASS]
```

### Advanced Configuration Settings for Barebone and Debian System to Maximize SD Card Storage

Using the configuration utility, access advanced settings for both the barebone hardware and Debian OS to ensure optimal SD card storage utilization, with automatic file system expansion during installation.

```
sudo raspi-config
```

```
raspi-config :: 3 Interface Options :: I1 SSH
raspi-config :: 6 Advanced Options :: A1 Expand filesystem
```

## Updating the System Repository

After installing Debian Lite, the first step is to update the software repository using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

## VIM: Fixing Arrow Key Issues in Vim Editor for Console

To address special key issues, such as arrow keys and delete functions, within the console editor, you can use the following commands:

For the current user (pi):
```
echo "set nocompatible" > ~/.vimrc
echo "set backspace=indent,eol,start" >> ~/.vimrc
```

For the root user:
```
sudo su
echo "set nocompatible" > ~/.vimrc
echo "set backspace=indent,eol,start" >> ~/.vimrc
```

## Network: Customizing the Hostname for Network Identification

To improve network identification, change the default hostname 'raspberrypi' to 'terminal' using the following commands. Replace 'raspberrypi' with 'terminal' and save the file:

```
sudo vi /etc/hostname
terminal
```

```
sudo vi /etc/hosts
127.0.1.1 terminal
```

## X-Window: Installing a Minimal X-Window System

To set up a minimal X-Window system, use the following command. This command will install the necessary components for a minimal X-Window environment without additional recommended packages.

```
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends xinit xserver-xorg
```

## Openbox: Configuring Openbox Window Manager for Raspberry Pi

The Openbox window manager for XWindow is a minimalist option that consumes only 7MB of memory, making it ideal for low-capacity devices like Raspberry Pi. After installing Openbox, you can apply the 'win10mod.obt' theme to give your windows a Windows 10-style appearance.

To install Openbox, use the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y openbox
```

To manually start XWindow after installing Openbox, use the following command:

```
startx
```
